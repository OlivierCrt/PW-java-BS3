# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java

## Description  
This project is designed to help you learn and practice the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. It covers key principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction through practical examples and exercises.

---

## Key Concepts Covered  

### 1. **Classes and Objects**  
   - Learn how to define classes and create objects.  
   - Understand constructors, instance variables, and methods.  

### 2. **Inheritance**  
   - Explore how to create subclasses and extend functionality from parent classes.  
   - Understand method overriding and the `super` keyword.  

### 3. **Polymorphism**  
   - Study method overloading and overriding.  
   - Learn how to use interfaces and abstract classes to achieve runtime polymorphism.  

### 4. **Encapsulation**  
   - Practice data hiding using access modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`).  
   - Implement getter and setter methods to control access to class fields.  

### 5. **Abstraction**  
   - Understand the concept of abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces.  
   - Learn how to define blueprints for classes without implementation details.
